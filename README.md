# Chat_Bot_Basic_EndToEnd_Model_Seq-Seq
This project implements a text-based question-answering system using a neural network with Keras and TensorFlow. It processes story-question-answer triplets, leverages embeddings, attention mechanisms, and LSTMs to predict answers. The model is trained, evaluated, and allows custom story-question inputs for predictions.
